Webpack is a JavaScript static [module](/what-are-javascript-modules) bundler. It collects all a website's assets (e.g. images, styles, etc.), JavaScript, and JavaScript dependencies and combines them into a single, or small number of, static file(s). This allows for developers to create complex web applications built using Javascript, while still delivering high performant load times. Along with module bundling, with Webpack you get features like:

- [Tree-shaking](/what-is-tree-shaking)
- [Code splitting](/what-is-code-splitting)
- [Module lazy loading](/what-is-module-lazy-loading)
- [Hot module replacement](/what-is-hot-module-replacement)

Webpack can also be combined with [minifiers](/what-is-minification), [transpilers](/what-is-transpiling), and other asset processing tools.
