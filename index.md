# Hi I'm Will ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer in the Reno/Tahoe area and I built <a href="https://cyberhoodie.com">CyberHoodie</a>, a web development consultancy. Do you have an idea or project you want built for the web? Well, you're in luck! <a href="https://cyberhoodie.com">CyberHoodie</a> and I can help.

**Interesting fact about me:** I have a slight obsession with [The Office](https://twitter.com/theofficenbc). If you like it too, I'm sure we'll be best buds.

## /recommendations

Will is the best tech lead I've worked with over my 20 year career in software development. He's very smart, a quick study with business logic and new technologies, and has excellent communication skills. Will was hired as a contractor, promoted to tech lead within three months, and has since been leading all the technical conversations across different teams (documenting technical designs as well as researching the relevant components and new technologies to form the service-oriented architecture for our platform workflow engine). The team has become more productive and motivated under Will's leadership and guidance. I highly recommend Will and hope to work on more projects with him in the future.

Will is a talented engineer, a motivated learner, a consistent positive energy, and a highly-effective communicator. Will holds himself to extremely high standards in all of his work and it shows. His deliverables consistently impressed me and his teammates. Will was able to jump head-first into a rapid and challenging development project at Breadware and excel in it. I highly recommend Will.

Will was an excellent addition to our team. He came in as principally a Rails developer, but dove directly into our React/Typescript stack and quickly got oriented and started building awesome stuff - a testament to his web development prowess. He took the time to seek out and fill gaps in his knowledge, was not afraid to ask questions, and was always ready to offer solutions when building out new features. He had well organized and clean code, was a team player, and overall was pleasant to work with. Anyone would be lucky to have him.

Itâ€™s rare that you find a programmer and co-founder like Will. I have had the pleasure of collaborating on multiple projects and companies with him over the years, and would jump at the opportunity to do it again. Willâ€™s ability to deliver well thought out and tested web applications is unlike any I have seen. It's truly a joy when your developer says something is done, and it actually is. Beyond his exceptional deliverables and deep knowledge of rails, he's also willing and ready to do what it takes to get the project done. It's not a joke when I say I've come back into the office the next day before a dead line, and he's still there making sure everything is in order. Any company would greatly benefit from Will.

I had the pleasure of working with Will at Wilderness Travel, collaborating on
several different projects. I was particularly impressed by his ability to break
down common design elements into reusable components, leaving the company's
codebase to be easily maintainable. Besides his technical competence, his
positive mindset to continuously learn and excel would be a true asset to any
team.Â

[Will] is a great programmer with good communication skills. Having the experience co-running his own company makes him an ideal candidate for startups and big companies alike. He is able to relate technical and business needs and achieve results with loose and changing specifications. Great understanding of lean and test driven development. It has been a truly fun and enjoyable experience working with [Will].
